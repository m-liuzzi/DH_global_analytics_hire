 1. How many sessions are there?
 SQL query: 
 
 SELECT 
  count(visitId) as total_sessions
 FROM
  `dhh-analytics-hiringspace.GoogleAnalyticsSample`.ga_sessions_export
  
  2. How many sessions does each visitor create?
SQL query:

SELECT 
   fullVisitorId,
  count(visitId)
 FROM
  `dhh-analytics-hiringspace.GoogleAnalyticsSample`.ga_sessions_export
 GROUP BY
  fullVisitorId
 
 3. How much time does it take on average to reach the order_confirmation screen per
session (in minutes)?
SQL query:

SELECT 
  AVG(timeOnSite/60) as time_needed_minutes
FROM
 `dhh-analytics-hiringspace.GoogleAnalyticsSample`.ga_sessions_export

4. By using the GoogleAnalyticsSample data and BackendDataSample tables, analyse
how often users tend to change their location in the beginning of their journey (screens
like home and listing) versus in checkout and on order placement and demonstrate the
the deviation between earlier and later inputs (if any) in terms of coordinates change.
Then, using the BackendDataSample table, see if those customers who changed
their address ended placing orders and if those orders were delivered successfully, if
so, did they match their destination.
